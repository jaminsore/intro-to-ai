<h1> Homework 4 -- due Wedenesday November 11</h1>

This homework will be graded out of 100 points.  It will count 7% of the
grade.  
<br>

<h4>Written questions</h4>

<ol>
<li> [10 points]  
You are given the following set of sentences in propositional calculus:
  <ol>
  <li> Humid &rArr; &not; (Hot &and; &not; Sticky) 
  <li> &not; Hot  &and; Sunny &rArr; Pleasant 
  <li> Sunny &and; Humid 
  <li> Sunny &or; &not; Pleasant 
  </ol>
Do the following:
<ol>
<li> convert them to CNF,
<li> prove by resolution "Sticky &or; Pleasant",
<li> Try to prove  "Sticky &and; Pleasant".  Can you prove it? if not, what
can you conclude?
</ol>

<li>[10 points]
Show that every CNF clause can be rewritten in the form
(P1 &and; .. Pm) &rArr; (Q1 &or; .. Qn)
where the Ps and Qs are proposition symbols.  
<br> This form is called implicative normal form or Kowalski 
form (see question 7.13, page 282 of the textbook).  

<li>[15 points]
Write the following sentences in predicate calculus, using appropriate
predicates. The predicates have to be used consistently across sentences.
<ol>
<li> All big houses are expensive.
<li> All expensive houses are big.
<li> A house is expensive if it is big.
<li> Some condominiums are more expensive that some big houses.
<li> There is only one house with a garden.
</ol>

<li> [15 points]
For each of the following English sentences, decide if the logic
sentence is a correct translation or not.  If not
explain why not and correct it:

<ol>
<li>There is only one house in Minneapolis that is pink.
<br>
exists x house(x) &and; in(x,Minneapolis) &and; color(x,Pink)

<li> There is a house that is bigger than any apartment.
<br>
forall x  apartment(x) &rArr; exists y (house(y) &and; bigger(y,x))

<li> Every apartment is cheaper than every house.
<br>
forall x apartment(x)  &rArr; [exists y house(y) &and; cheaper(x,y)]

<li> Some farms cost less than some houses.
<br>
exists x farm(x) &and; exists y house(y) &rArr; cheaper(x,y)

<li>All houses have at least one bathroom.
<br>
forall x [house(x) &and; exists y bathroom(y)] &rArr; in(x,y)
</ol>

<li> [15 points]
Prove by resolution that the following set of clauses (in predicate
calculus) is unsatisfiable. Assume that upper case arguments are constant,
lower case arguments are variable:
<ol> 
<li> G(B) 
<li> &not; G(x) &or; H(x) 
<li> &not; H(z) &or; I(z)
<li> &not; H(w) &or; J(w,D) 
<li> &not; I(B) &or; J(C,B)
<li> &not; I(q) &or; &not; J(q,y) 
</ol>

<li> [15 points]  
You are given the following knowledge: "All people who are rich and are 
not stupid are happy. Those people who read are not stupid. John can read and 
he is rich. Happy people have exciting lives. 
Do the following:
<ol>
<li> write the statements in predicate calculus 
<li> convert the statements to CNF 
<li> prove by resolution "can anyone be found with an exciting life?"
</ol>
</ol>

<h4>Lisp questions</h4>
You need to submit the source files and the Lisp output. 

<p>
For this part we will use the logic package in aima.  If you have
not downloaded it, go to
<a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/lisp/doc/install.html">
http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/lisp/doc/install.html</a> and follow the
instructions.    If you have downloaded it do
<pre>
(load "aima.lisp")
(aima-load 'all)
(aima-compile)   ; only the first time.  Do (aima-load 'logic) afterward
(test 'logic)    ; tests the functions in the logic package
</pre>
As always read the file 
<a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/lisp/logic/test-logic.lisp">
logic/test-logic.lisp</a> to see examples of
how to call the functions you will need to use.  Look in particular
at how to write the logical connectors.
<p>

Answer the following questions using the aima software:
<ol>
<li> [5 points] Show the truth table of the following sentences:
<ol>
<li> (P or (not P and Q)) equivalent (P or Q)   
<li> ((P implies Q) and (not Q)) implies P
<li> ((P or Q) and (P implies R) and (Q implies R)) implies R
<li> ((P or Q) and R) equivalent (P or (Q and R))
</ol>
What can you conclude for each of the cases, i.e., are they valid? satisfiable?
unsatisfiable?
[write this part of the answer as a comment in your lisp file or as a separate file].
<li> [5 points] 
<ol>
For this problem you need to do resolution in propositional 
calculus using the aima software.
<li> create a propositional data base
<code> (setq kb (make-prop-kb)) </code>
<li> use <code> (tell kb "...")</code>
where the ... have to be replaced by propositional axpressions to
represent the exercise we did in class:
"If the unicorn is mythical, then
it is immortal but if it is not mythical then it is a mortal mammal.
If the unicorn is either immortal or a mammal, then it is horned.
The unicorn is magical, if it is horned."
<li> use <code>ask</code> to answer the following questions "is 
the unicorn mythical", "is the unicorn magical", "is the unicorn horned"?
</ol>
<li> [10 points] 
Repeat Question 6 (All people who are rich ... ) using the
aima software. 
You'll need first to to create a Horn database
<code>(setf kb (make-horn-kb))</code>.
Use <code>tell</code> to add the knowledge,
and <code>ask</code> to ask the question.
Make sure you write the clauses as Horn clauses, which means no negative literals
and at most one literal on the right hand side of the implication.
</ol>
