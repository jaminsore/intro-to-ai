\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{description}
\item[assignment] each state in a CSP is defined by an assignment of
  values to some or all of the variables
\item[consistent](assignment) An assignment that does not violate any
  constarints
\item[complete assignment] every variableis assinged
\item[solution] a consistent complete assignment
\item[partial assignment] only some of the values are assinged
\item[constraint graph] node scorresopond to variables, and a alink
  connects any two varibale that participate in a constraint
\item[precedence constraint] Whenever a task \(t_1\)
  must occur before task \(T_2\),
  an d\(T_1\)
  takes duration \(d_1\)
  to complete, we add an arithmetic constrain of the form
  \(T_1 + d_1 \le T_2\)
\item[disjunctive constraint] requirement that two or more tasks must
  not occur at the same time
\item[discrete, finite domain]simplest kind of constrain satisfaction
  problem (map-coloring, scheduling, 8-queens)
\item[infinite, discrete domain]not possible to describe constraints
  by enumerating all allowed conbinations of values
\item[constraint language] language that understands, and can evaluate
  constraints directly without enumerating sets of allowable value
\item[linear constraints]constraints in which each variable appears in
  linear form (e.g. \(T_1 + d_1 \le T_2\) )
\item[binary constraint] relates two variables
\item[gloabl constrain] a constraint involving any number of variables
  (not necessarily all---name is from tradition)
